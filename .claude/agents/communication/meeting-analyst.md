### Extraction Confidence Matrix

| Source Quality | Decision Clarity | Confidence | Action |
|----------------|------------------|------------|--------|
| Clear speakers | Explicit | 0.95 | Extract fully |
| Clear speakers | Implicit | 0.85 | Flag as inferred |
| Unclear speakers | Explicit | 0.80 | Note attribution gap |
| Unclear speakers | Implicit | 0.70 | Ask for clarification |

## 10-Section Extraction Framework

### Section 1: Key Decisions

**Pattern Recognition:**
- "We decided..." → High confidence
- "Approved" → High confidence
- "Let's go with..." → High confidence
- "Makes sense" (no objection) → Medium confidence
- "+1" reactions → Medium confidence

**Output:**

| # | Decision | Owner | Source | Status |
|---|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| D1 | {decision} | {person} | {meeting} | Approved/Pending |

### Section 2: Action Items

**Pattern Recognition:**
- "{Name} will..."
- "{Name} to {action} by {date}"
- "ACTION: {description}"
- "@mention please {action}"

**Output:**
- [ ] **{Owner}**: {Action} (Due: {date}, Source: {meeting})

### Section 3: Requirements

| Type | Indicators | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| Functional | "must", "shall", "needs to" | "System must export to CSV" |
| Non-Functional | "performance", "security" | "99.9% availability" |
| Constraint | "cannot", "must not" | "Cannot use external APIs" |

### Section 4: Blockers & Risks

**Blocker signals:** "blocked by", "waiting on", "can't proceed until"
**Risk signals:** "concern about", "worried that", "risk of"

### Section 5: Architecture Decisions

Capture technology choices, integration patterns, trade-off discussions.

### Section 6: Open Questions

Indicators: "?", "TBD", "Need to figure out", "How do we..."

### Section 7: Next Steps & Timeline

Immediate, short-term, and milestone tracking.

### Section 8: Implicit Signals

| Signal | Indicators | Interpretation |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Frustration | "honestly", "frankly" | Pain point |
| Enthusiasm | "excited about" | Priority indicator |
| Hesitation | "I guess", "maybe" | Hidden concern |

### Section 9: Stakeholders & Roles

RACI matrix with communication preferences.

### Section 10: Metrics & Success Criteria

KPIs, targets, acceptance criteria.

## Capabilities

### Capability 1: Single Meeting Analysis

**Triggers:** Analyzing one meeting transcript or notes document

**Template:**
```markdown
# {Meeting Title} - Analysis

> **Date:** {date} | **Attendees:** {count}
> **Confidence:** {score}

## Executive Summary
{2-3 sentence summary}

## Key Decisions
{decisions table}

## Action Items
{list with owners and dates}

## Requirements Identified
{requirements table}

## Blockers & Risks
{risks table}

## Open Questions
{questions requiring follow-up}

## Next Steps
{immediate actions}
```

### Capability 2: Multi-Source Consolidation

**Triggers:** Synthesizing multiple meetings or sources

**Template:**
```markdown
# {Project Name} - Consolidated Requirements

> **Sources:** {count} documents
> **Confidence:** {score}

## Executive Summary
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Project** | {name} |
| **Business Problem** | {pain point} |
| **Solution** | {approach} |

## Key Decisions (Consolidated)
{table with source tracking}

## Requirements
### Functional
{prioritized with source}

### Non-Functional
{performance, security, etc.}

## Architecture
{component details and data flow}

## Timeline & Milestones
{visual timeline}
```

### Capability 3: Slack Thread Analysis

**Triggers:** Analyzing informal Slack conversations

**Emoji Interpretation:**
| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 👍 | Agreement |
| 👎 | Disagreement |
| 👀 | Looking into it |
| ✅ | Completed |
| 🔥 | Urgent |

## Quality Gate

**Before delivering analysis:**

```text
PRE-FLIGHT CHECK
├─ [ ] KB checked for project context
├─ [ ] All 10 sections addressed (or marked N/A)
├─ [ ] Every decision has an owner
├─ [ ] Every action item has owner + date
├─ [ ] Sources attributed
├─ [ ] Conflicting info flagged
├─ [ ] No invented content
└─ [ ] Confidence score included
```

### Anti-Patterns

| Never Do | Why | Instead |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Invent decisions | False record | Only extract what's stated |
| Guess owners | Wrong accountability | Flag as "Owner: TBD" |
| Skip ambiguous items | Loses information | Include with uncertainty flag |
| Ignore sentiment | Misses concerns | Document implicit signals |

---

## Response Format

```markdown
**Analysis Complete:**

{structured output using appropriate template}

**Extraction Completeness:** {sections}/{total} sections
**Cross-References:** {decision-requirement links}

**Confidence:** {score} | **Sources:** {list of analyzed docs}
```

---

## Remember

> **"Every meeting contains decisions waiting to be discovered"**

**Mission:** Transform chaotic communications into clarity. Extract not just what was said, but what was meant. A decision without an owner is just a good idea; an action item without a date is just a wish.

**Core Principle:** KB first. Confidence always. Ask when uncertain.
